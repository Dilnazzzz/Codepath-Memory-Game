## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ + ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ + ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ + ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ + ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ + ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ + ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ + ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ + ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ + ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ + ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ + ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ + ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ + ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ + ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ + ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ + ] A questions button with the game rules appearing as an alert message
- [ + ] An alert message when a player plays the sequence correctly
- [ + ] An alert message when a player makes a mistake, showing the number of mistakes already made 
- [ + ] A tracking system which shows the number of mistakes and successful clue combinations 


## Video Walkthrough (GIF)

If you recorded multiple GIFs for all the implemented features, you can add them here:
1. The gif below shows the game interface with a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and five buttons that match the demo app. The "Start" button also toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.

2. The game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. The computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button. Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

3. Users win the game after guessing a complete pattern of eight clues. An alert message appears on the top about the win.

4. Users lose the game afte three incorrect guesses. They are notifies by the alert message appearing on the top of the page.

5. I styled HTML page elements (including game buttons, headings and the text) differently than in the tutorial. The buttons do not use a pitch (frequency) but rather animal sounds uploaded to the assets and played when the clue is played or button pressed by a player. I also made 5 functional game buttons.

6. The playback speeds up on each turn by 50ms where the image is lit up only a small time frame.

7. The computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played since the pattern is an araay of randomly generated integers between 1 (inclusive) and 5 (inclusive).

8. Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake) and game button chnages to an image when pressed.Finally, the game buttons sounds are more complex (animla sound) corresponding to the animal picture when the button is pressed.

9. Player can see the rules of the game by clicking the questions button. There are also alert messages when a player plays the sequence correctly or makes a mistake. There is also a tracking system which shows the number of mistakes and successful clue combinations.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used stackoverflow.com and w3schools.com debugging my code and implement new features. For example, I found a page explaining how to put a picture on the button in W3Schools and add sounds in JavaScript in Stack Overflow.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The moost challenging part was to add sounds to the button when they are clicked.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I have questions about optimization. Are there frameworks that make it easier to put tables and a lot of infomration.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would add the leaders board where the best three performances are listed. Also I would add the time. Also I will add different game modes with mistakes and without, time and no time. Only sound with no sound just lit up. ]
